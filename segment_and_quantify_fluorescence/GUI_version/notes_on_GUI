tk box in front of the main window
project path text box should be longer
osnormpath normalisation to bring parity between mac and windows.
Popup window for defining parameters to make clear am selecting sample image

different channels and z and number of z/channels?
parameters_template saved somewhere obvious.
A way to show it is loading
different segmentation models
be able to copy and paste the parameters file into a different project
cancel button or x shouldn't crash the program

More sensitive lower values for parameters

Integrate into run analysis

Ability to run analysis from parameters file

On main window should have analysis and processing separate

analysis window should have better formatting
rename to segmentation channel
use correct parameters

processing bar should be channel dependent, or do all processes per channel
general loading bar fix




Still before shrews:
1. Characterise cells - DONE
2. Analyse this data using my separate script
3. optimise iou threshold
4. Then run my other images.
5. Plot.
output of scatter plot?

By today - set up processing and segmentation for overnight.


I did not ask you to remove the option of the other columns for the x and y axis, I still want to be able to have z_position, pixel_count, cell_number. Bring it back. Only write out the functions you are changing in this prompt!


Bra+ Sox1+ Sox2+ NMP
Bra+ Sox1- Sox2+ NMP
Bra- Sox1+ Sox2- Neural
Bra- Sox1+ Sox2+ Neural
Bra+ Sox1- Sox2- Mesoderm

Bra+ Sox1+ Sox2- Uncharacterised
Bra- Sox1- Sox2+ Pluripotent
Bra- Sox1- Sox2- Uncharacterised

Bra+ Sox2+ NMP
Sox2-
Bra- Sox1+ Neural
Bra+ AND NOT NMP Mesoderm

Uncharacterised options:
Sox2- AND NOT Mesoderm AND NOT Neural

Mesoderm OR Neural = 

Pluripotent:
Sox2+ AND NOT NMP AND NOT NEURAL

Requires a NOT before the first gate too.
